# IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera <br>
> >This professional certificate teaches students how to build their own cloud-based applications and provides them the opportunity to practice working with the technologies behind those applications on a cloud platform using Cloud Native methodologies. Practical skills in tools and technologies that successful software developers use to build, deploy, test, run, and manage Full Stack Cloud Native applications are covered. Students develop skill sets in a variety of front-end and back-end technologies including: Cloud foundations, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Node.js, React, Cloud Native practices, DevOps, CI/CD, Containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Istio, Python programming, Databases, SQL, NoSQL, Django ORM, Bootstrap, Application Security, Microservices, Serverless computing, and more. <br><br>

## Certificate Course Projects: <br>
### Course 1 - Introduction to Cloud Computing <br>
> > This course introduces students to the core concepts of cloud computing whereby they gain the foundational knowledge required to understand cloud computing from a business perspective and as a cloud practitioner. Furthermore, students come to understand the definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing, its history, the business case for cloud computing, and emerging technology use-cases enabled by cloud. Prominent service providers (e.g. AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc.) are introduced along with the services they offer. Case studies of cloud computing across industry verticals are considered. Specifically, cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid) and the key components of a cloud infrastructure (VMs, Networking, Storage - File, Block, Object, CDN) are covered. In addition, emergent cloud trends and practices including - Hybrid Multicloud, Microservices, Serverless, DevOps, Cloud Native and Application Modernization are also covered as well as the basics of cloud security, monitoring, and different job roles in the cloud industry. <br><br>

### Course 2 - Introduction to Cloud Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
> > The final project for this course, coded in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, is a **Simple Interest Calculator** web application named *Everyone Can Get Rich*.<br><br>
It can be found at the following URL: https://lllichtenstein.github.io/vftvk-Simple-Interest-Calculator/ <br><br>
> > In this project scenario I am a web developer for an NGO tasked with completing an unfinished web application to look and function like that given in the requirements. Everyone Can Get Rich is a non-governmental charity organization. This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. They have hired a developer to create an online application. This app, titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount to save, the number of years to keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank will pay. The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements.
### Course 3 - Developing Cloud Native Applications <br>
> > The final project for this course, **Movie Reviews Database**, is an IBM Cloudant connected, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery-enabled (CI/CD) application; it can be found at https://movies-reviews-database-7b7.mybluemix.net/.<br><br>
> > In this project scenario, I am a developer for a site that allows the general public to review movies. The site sorts the reviews into color categories depending on their general tone. The previous developer wrote the basic code and stored it in GitHub, but has left the company without warning; I have been engaged to complete the work. My task is to refine the existing code and host the application on Cloud. I have chosen IBM Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Following cloud native best practices, I have decided to enable CI/CD to ensure any changes made in the future will be automatically deployed to the application. To achieve this, I forked the GitHub code to my own repo, created the required services in my IBM Cloud account and connected those services to the application. Originally negative movie reviews appeared in orange. To test the CI/CD configuration, negative reviews are changed from orange to red, and the color change is verified.<br><br>
> > Steps taken to complete this project:<br>
**Part A: Create Natural Language Understanding and Cloudant Services on IBM Cloud**<br>
> > &emsp; Create an instance of the Cloudant service.<br>
> > &emsp; Create an instance of the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service.<br>
**Part B: Deploy an Application to Cloud Foundry**<br>
> > &emsp; Create a Node.js application with the Cloud Foundry service.<br>
**Part C: Connect IBM Cloud Services to Cloud Foundry Applications**<br>
> > &emsp; Connect the Cloudant service to the Node.js application.<br>
> > &emsp; Connect the NLU service to the Node.js application.<br>
> > &emsp; Restage the application.<br>
**Part D: Deploy an Application to Cloud Foundry**<br>
> > &emsp; Fork the project repository into my GitHub account.<br>
> > &emsp; Open the IBM Cloud Shell and Clone my fork.<br>
> > &emsp; Make the required changes in the manifest.yml file.<br>
> > &emsp; Push the application to IBM Cloud using the CLI.<br>
**Part E: Create CI/CD Pipeline**<br>
> > &emsp; Create an instance of the Continuous Delivery service.<br>
> > &emsp; Create a toolchain and delivery pipeline.<br>
> > &emsp; Configure the toolchain to use my GitHub repository.<br>
**Part F: Deliver Changes Using CI/CD**<br>
> > &emsp; Make the required Node.js application source code changes.<br>
> > &emsp; Push the changes to the repository.<br>
> > &emsp; Confirm that the application was refreshed.<br>
### Course 4 - Developing Cloud Apps with Node.js and React <br>
> > in progress
### Course 5 - Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift <br>
> > in progress
### Course 6 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development <br>
> > Students learn how to analyze data using python from the basics of python to exploring different types of data including data preparation, simple statistical analysis, data visualization, and future trend prediction.<br>
> > Topics covered include:<br>
> > &emsp; 1. Importing datasets<br>
> > &emsp; 2. Cleaning the data<br>
> > &emsp; 3. Data frame manipulation<br>
> > &emsp; 4. Summarizing the data<br>
> > &emsp; 5. Building machine learning Regression models<br>
> > &emsp; 6. Building data pipelines<br>
> >Students learn to use pandas, NumPy and SciPy libraries to work with a sample dataset. Specifically, pandas is used to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize datasets, and scikit-learn machine learning algorithms are used to build smart models and make predictions.<br><br>
> > For this assignment, I am a data analyst working at a real estate investment trust which invests in residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of homes given a set of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, etc. Using IBM Watson Studio, I analyze and predict housing prices by fitting these attributes or features to a Linear Regression model. The dataset used contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, for homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.<br>
