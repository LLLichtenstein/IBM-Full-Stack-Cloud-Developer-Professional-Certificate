# IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera <br>
> >This professional certificate teaches students how to build their own cloud-based applications and provides them the opportunity to practice working with the technologies behind those applications on a cloud platform using Cloud Native methodologies. Practical skills in tools and technologies that successful software developers use to build, deploy, test, run, and manage Full Stack Cloud Native applications are covered. Students develop skill sets in a variety of front-end and back-end technologies including: Cloud foundations, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Node.js, React, Cloud Native practices, DevOps, CI/CD, Containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Istio, Python programming, Databases, SQL, NoSQL, Django ORM, Bootstrap, Application Security, Microservices, Serverless computing, and more. <br><br>

## Certificate Course Projects: <br>
### Course 1 - Introduction to Cloud Computing <br>
> > This course introduces students to the core concepts of cloud computing whereby they gain the foundational knowledge required to understand cloud computing from a business perspective and as a cloud practitioner. Furthermore, students come to understand the definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing, its history, the business case for cloud computing, and emerging technology use-cases enabled by cloud. Prominent service providers (e.g. AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc.) are introduced along with the services they offer. Case studies of cloud computing across industry verticals are considered. Specifically, cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid) and the key components of a cloud infrastructure (VMs, Networking, Storage - File, Block, Object, CDN) are covered. In addition, emergent cloud trends and practices including - Hybrid Multicloud, Microservices, Serverless, DevOps, Cloud Native and Application Modernization are also covered as well as the basics of cloud security, monitoring, and different job roles in the cloud industry. <br><br>

### Course 2 - Introduction to Cloud Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
> > This course leads students through the languages and tools needed to develop cloud applications. Students learn how internet servers and clients work together to deliver applications to users. The course introduces at a high level application development in the Cloud; that is, front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. In addition, it focuses on the languages employed for front-end development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - as well as tools that store projects and keep track of changes made to project files, such as Git and GitHub.<br><br>
> > In this project scenario I am a web developer for an NGO tasked with completing an unfinished web application to look and function like that given in the requirements. Everyone Can Get Rich is a non-governmental charity organization. This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. They have hired a developer to create an online application. This app, Simple Interest Calculator, coded in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript computes the interest one can earn given the amount to save, the number of years to keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank will pay. The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements.<br>

### Course 3 - Developing Cloud Native Applications <br>
> >  Students learn about tools and techniques for developing cloud native apps; that is, building, deploying, testing, and running web applications in IBM Cloud. Specifically, they learn the command-line interface (CLIs) to develop, test, and deploy a Node.js application and relevant services for both IBM Cloud and Cloud Foundry. In addition, they learn the steps for enabling integrated continuous delivery toolchains to automate application builds, deployment, and monitoring.<br><br>
> > The final project for this course, Movie Reviews Database, is an IBM Cloudant connected, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery-enabled (CI/CD) application.
> > In this project scenario, I am a developer for a site that allows the general public to review movies. The site sorts the reviews into color categories depending on their general tone. The previous developer wrote the basic code and stored it in GitHub, but has left the company without warning; I have been engaged to complete the work. My task is to refine the existing code and host the application on Cloud. I have chosen IBM Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Following cloud native best practices, I have decided to enable CI/CD to ensure any changes made in the future will be automatically deployed to the application. To achieve this, I forked the GitHub code to my own repo, created the required services in my IBM Cloud account and connected those services to the application. Originally negative movie reviews appeared in orange. To test the CI/CD configuration, negative reviews are changed from orange to red, and the color change is verified.<br><br>
> > Steps taken to complete this project:<br>
Part A: Create Natural Language Understanding and Cloudant Services on IBM Cloud<br>
Part B: Create a Node.js application with the Cloud Foundry service.<br>
Part C: Connect IBM Cloud Services - Cloudant and NLU - to the Cloud Foundry application (Node.js application)<br>
Part D: Deploy an Application to Cloud Foundry<br>
> > &emsp; Fork the project repository into my GitHub account.<br>
> > &emsp; Open the IBM Cloud Shell and Clone my fork.<br>
> > &emsp; Make the required changes in the manifest.yml file.<br>
> > &emsp; Push the application to IBM Cloud using the CLI.<br>
Part E: Create CI/CD Pipeline<br>
> > &emsp; Create an instance of the Continuous Delivery service.<br>
> > &emsp; Create a toolchain and delivery pipeline.<br>
> > &emsp; Configure the toolchain to use my GitHub repository.<br>
Part F: Deliver Changes Using CI/CD**<br>
> > &emsp; Make the required Node.js application source code changes.<br>
> > &emsp; Push the changes to the repository.<br>
> > &emsp; Confirm that the application was refreshed.<br>

### Course 6 - Python for Data Science, AI & Development <br>
> > in progress
### Course 7 - Python Project for AI & Application Development <br>
> > This mini-course applies foundational Python skills by implementing the IBM Cloud AI service Watson Language Translator and the microweb framework Flask to develop a web application to translate English to French and vice versa. The course also includes unit testing, Static Code Analysis with Pylint, and python packaging. <br><br> 
> > For the final project, I assume the role of a developer for an IT services company which has just won a big project with a hotel in Quebec, Canada serving customers with a large French-speaking population. Since communication will also occur in English, there is a need to provide the ability to translate between the two languages. I developed a server with end points that allow translation from English to French and from French to English. I was given a skeleton structure, on top of which I built the functionality in python, Flask, and Watson Language Translator. I unit tested the code, ran a coding standards check with Pylint, and packaged the application.<br><br>
